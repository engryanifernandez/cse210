/* 
This C# Program Code is made by Hazel Diane Fernandez for W05 Prove: Developerâ€”Mindfulness

 This program provides a mindfulness app with three different kinds of activities:
 Breathing Activity, Reflection Activity, and Listing Activity.
 Users can select an activity from the menu, input the duration, and engage in the session.
 
 Added Features:
 1. Name Input: 
    - Users are prompted to input their name at the start of the program.
    - This personalization enhances user experience.
 
 2. Activity Logging:
    - The program keeps track of how many activities have been performed in total.
    - Logs the last activity performed and its duration.
    - Logs the date and time of the last session for accountability and tracking.
    - Activity details are saved to a file named "activity_log.txt" for future reference.
 
 Each activity includes:
 - A starting message with the activity name, description, and user-defined duration.
 - A guided session with pauses, animations, and prompts.
 - A concluding message congratulating the user and summarizing the session details.

The program design uses object-oriented principles, such as inheritance, to manage the 
shared functionality of activities through a base class and specific functionality in derived classes.
